# santa-game

Create by Koen, BeCode/Antwerpen.

> I created a Santa game that we played the next day with the entire campus. I grouped both classes together to foster a good bond between the classes. The game was also educational and I wrote over a [ that they had the answer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcpM7lUC2rvf9QnAq_IJHuyA0OGMz3L6w8ExoMfhGu8/edit#gid=0) in some interactive quiz. All questions where related to our Syllabus. 
> I am actually hoping to continue to work on this because I think we can reuse if for different occasions.

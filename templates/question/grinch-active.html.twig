    <h1>The grinch strikes back!</h1>

    <p>The grinch corrupted this question for a while, and stole <b>{{ stolenGifts }} <img src="{{ asset('assets/images/icons/026-gift.png') }}" height="16" /></b> from you!</p>

    <p>In total the grinch has already stolen <b>{{ team.stolenGifts }} <img src="{{ asset('assets/images/icons/026-gift.png') }}" height="16" />
        </b> from you! Maybe you should go to his lair and challenge him to a duel?</p>
